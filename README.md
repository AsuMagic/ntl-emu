# **nanoThallium** Emulator

nanoThallium is a RISC architecture. This is a WIP emulator for this architecture.  
It is not possible (yet) to load arbitrary machine code from a file, but an assembler is on the way.

## Features

- Reference implementation for the ntl architecture.  
- Near complete ISA support.  
- Interrupt & CPU exception support.

## Roadmap

- Support loading CPU programs from file.
- Port I/O support.
- Virtual peripherial support.
- Debugging features.
- Unit testing (preferably external to the emulator).
